This is the best Omega 3 in the market. it is good for cardiovascular and using selected small fishes like Sardines, Mackerel and Anchovies which are less toxin compared to big fishes with high toxin over their longer lives. Furthermore I did test this fish oil and it didn't dissolve Styrofoam cup indicating there is no ethanol used in the process of getting oil as we know that ethanol is not good for our organs in long term (search \"ethanol fish oil\" in Youtube)... &gt;&gt;&gt;Please click on my name HAFIZ (the above green text) to get more info and less price.</div>, <div class=\"review-text\">I love this omega 3 fish oil very much because it's very cheap yet effective and doesn't contain any harmful chemicals. I've already tried a lot of brands of omega 3 and this one is one of the best and effective.

Really high quality.</div>, <div class=\"review-text\">Thank you,\n",
      "Good Product !</div>, <div class=\"review-text\">Fantastic  and happy  for the price, couse in latvia we can buy only  few good omega 3 about 14 euro and it will last just one month .</div>, <div class=\"review-text\">Not sure what change should be shown in my body after taking this but i think this product has no side effect on me. So i think this product is great. Oh and shipping was faster than what i expected :)</div>, <div class=\"review-text\">Very good product!!You will be exactly happy use-G HP 8 1 8 (write together) </div>]\n",

My husband had knee joint pains and this Fish oil helped and pain is gone after a couple of weeks. The EPA and DHA levels are high and 1 tablet a day is enough. It might look a bit more pricey than other fish oil products but  account  the EPA and DHA are higher than most other Fish oil. Also I take often on an empty stomach and there is not after taste or anything.</div>, <div class=\"review-text\">Will use on my first time</div>, <div class=\"review-text\">Excellent product </div>, <div class=\"review-text\">Кожа засияла. </div>, <div class=\"review-text\">very good price as compared to others. good\n",

Taking all 6 capsules per day makes my face look next day like I've eaten a few chocolate bars and cakes.  So I can take not more than 3- 4 capsules per day in the first half of the day, like any other sweets or fat food, in order not to harm my skin.</div>, <div class=\"review-text\">I use long ago, Solgar - one of the most known for high quality of the products.</div>, <div class=\"review-text\">Excellent </div>]\n",

Using it has helped me lower my LDL and raise my HDL but I now buy it from another vendor since iHerb closed their customer service department. I tried using iHerb's email system and all they ever did was answer with \"boilerplate\" statements that never applied to my question. iHerb now rates only 1 star. </div>, <div class=\"review-text\">Isn't a news, Life Extension products are top quality products</div>, <div class=\"review-text\">After consuming about a month,  I noticed that my nails texture have become slightly smoother,  lesser vertical lines. It also helps to improve the immune system .  Overall is good to give it a try. </div>, <div class=\"review-text\">I require omega 3 as suggested by my GP. I was charged £19 extra on delivery, I was not informed this when I made the purchase which is not acceptable. I wrote iherb but got no reply. </div>, <div class=\"review-text\">A+</div>]\n",

This is the best Omega 3 in the market. it is good for cardiovascular and using selected small fishes like Sardines, Mackerel and Anchovies which are less toxin compared to big fishes with high toxin over their longer lives. Furthermore I did test this fish oil and it didn't dissolve Styrofoam cup indicating there is no ethanol used in the process of getting oil as we know that ethanol is not good for our organs in long term (search \"ethanol fish oil\" in Youtube)... >>>Please click on my name HAFIZ (the above green text) to get more info and less price.\n",

In the product information, they played with words to cover the presence of mercury when they say \"It is tested to be free of potentially harmful ***levels*** of contaminants\". This means it has contaminants, including mercury, but at non-harmful level. They say the same as what most of other products say. The only except is Solgar, who says clearly that their product is purified to eliminate mercury. But at the end, the product is good compared to its price.\n",

From what I researched, DHA is important for your brain health and EPA supports general wellness. Of course, you’ll need both. It’s quite a large bottle. 180 softgels. If you take two pills a day, that’ll last you three months. If you take one pill a day, that’ll last you six months. It’s really up to you. I eat quite a balanced diet so I only take 1 pill a day.

Now Foods has great pricing, you’ll definitely get more that expected. I will share a secret c o d e: N-H-B-8-6-9-4 (without -) for 5% or 10% o f f on your next order when checkout.

      "리뷰 GREAT PRODUCT!\n",
      "리뷰 This dietary supplementation of a NON GMO project verified omega three fatty acids oil is made from both anchovy as well as the bovine gelatine capsule by the Now Foods that is a GMP certified brand. In fact, I would like to worshipfully commend the sort of the flax oil as the omega three fatty acids that are the alpha linonelic acid (ALA) as well as both a precursor of both the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that is ethical vegan friendly rather than the sort of fish oil as the omega three fatty acids as well as both the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) qua the sorts of both the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Nevertheless, it is required the manifold enzymes whose the delta six desaturase has the limitation of the total amount to convert the alpha linonelic acid (ALA) that is a precursor of the docosahexaeonic acid (DHA) to the docosahexaeonic (DHA). Thus, the technology that can convert the alpha linonelic acid (ALA) that is a precursor of the docosahexaeonic acid (DHA) to the docosahexaeonic (DHA) for the production of the ethical vegan friendly dietary supplementation with regard to the plant based docosahexaeonic acid (DHA) is required for the higher ethical vegan friendly future. Furthermore, I would greatly appreciate it if the brand could produce the another version with the vegetarian capsule as well as the MSC certification.\n",

Reasonably priced and it comes in a generous amount, the only negative about this product is the softgel size, they are huge but other than that it is a great product which I will continue to buy.\n",
      "리뷰 The best omega with the best price what more do you need\n",
      "리뷰 My Grandma and Mom liked these one. I also like it : quick delivery, and for the cost-effectiveness. Only one tiny shortage ; while I put and clicked final transaction, I just missed the coupon discount, the coupon due was over 10 mins. !!!!!!!!\n",
      "리뷰 I ordered Omega-3 Fish Oil. Instead you send me some item called \"non-gmo lethicin\". And now your customer service refuse to correct the mistake and re-send me the correct item. You expect me to re-order a single item and pay the subsequent high shipping fee again. Horrible ethics! Very disappointed in this callous response.\n",
