The recipes are inconsistently put together & the instructions often don't agree with the ingredient lists. Overall I think the author has a great passion for ramen & that shines through. The BIG caveat for me is & remains one must take his recipes & ratios with a huge grain of salt - easy enough for an experienced cook, stupidly easy to be led astray for someone less experienced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example1: The Negi (scallion oil) condiment recipe calls for 1.5 cups oil/fat + 1/4 cup scallions to yield 1.5 cups scallion oil. That's crazy quantity of oil, I made it with 1/4 cup scallions & about that much oil & the result was perfectly flavored and very much enjoyed with tonights ramen dinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example2: Tare ratios are way too high, 50% of what the author suggests would be a good starting point. (I know ramen well those are too strong)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example3: Traditional clear chicken soup - Great recipe; made that stock today & it turned out great. WTF is one supposed to do with the 1/2 apple referenced ine the ingredients list??? The instructions in the recipe fail to mention said 1/2 apple altogether. I'm enough of a cook to know what to do with said ingredient but omitted it out of spite!\n",

Both of them are labelled XXL, as I'd paid for, however, they each fit him differently when he tried them on. The yellow shirt's sleeves are noticeably tight around his arms. And what's more is that the left sleeve fits his arm tighter than the right. Definitely poor tailoring. Once he tried the white shirt, we could both tell the difference immediately, as it fit him the way a XXL should, loosely comfortable. I've been impressed with the quality of Amazon Basics' tech accessory products so far, but I'm a little disappointed with their venture into clothing.\",\n",
